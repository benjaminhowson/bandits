# Bandits
The Bandits package is an easy-to-use framework for testing and comparing various bandit algorithms. Currently, the package implements numerous provably efficient algorithms for the problem, and more are to come! The BernoulliBandit environment included is a simple benchmark that allows one to experiment with the algorithms and investigate their performance. However, defining a custom environment is easy; see the template class in the final section!

# Problem Setting
Consider entering a casino. In front of you are five slot machines. You want to leave the casino with as much money as possible. It follows that you would like to find which of the five slot machines, on average, gives the highest reward. However, you have no information about any of the slot machines. How do you find the one with the highest expected reward while losing the least amount of money in the process? This problem is what bandit algorithms attempt to solve.
